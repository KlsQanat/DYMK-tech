			<h1>Diseases caused by Air pollution</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="box ">
			<h2>Asthma</h2>
			<p>One of the most common diseases caused by air pollution is asthma.  Breathing becomes difficult because it narrows, expands, and creates more mucus in the airways.  A condition of chronic air pollution known as asthma causes severe shortness of breath that makes even daily routine activities difficult.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box 4">
			<h2>Bronchitis</h2>
			<p>Bronchitis
 			Bronchitis can result from long-term exposure to elevated levels of air pollution, especially when there are significant amounts of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere.
 			Air pollution can cause bronchitis, an acute or chronic disease that affects the lining of the bronchial tubes (which carry air into and out of the lungs).  Shortness of breath and persistent, severe coughing with thick mucus are the main signs and symptoms of bronchitis.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box 5">
			<h2>Lung cancer</h2>
			<p>In 2013, the World Health Organization concluded that particulate air pollution can cause lung cancer.  Smoking, non-smokers' exposure to cigarette smoke, certain airborne pollutants, a family history, or long-term exposure to toxic air pollutants are major causes of lung or lung cancer.  Typical symptoms are severe chest pain, coughing, wheezing, hoarseness, and weight loss.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box 6">
			<h2>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</h2>
			<p> COPD is a chronic disease in which the airways of the lungs become blocked, making it difficult to breathe and causing wheezing and persistent coughing.  One of the common diseases caused by air pollution, COPD irreparably damages the lungs and can progress to more severe diseases, including bronchitis and emphysema. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="box 7">
			<h2>Cardiovascular Disease </h2>
			<p>Fine particles in polluted air can make blood vessels less efficient and speed up the hardening of arteries.
 			According to NIEHS experts, postmenopausal women who are regularly exposed to nitric oxides for a short time have a higher risk of hemorrhagic stroke.
			Low levels of high-density lipoprotein, or “good cholesterol,” can be caused by exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP), which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.
 			In addition, exposure to TRAP increases a pregnant woman's risk of developing significant fluctuations in blood pressure, often known as hypertensive disorders, according to a National Toxicology Program (NTP) article.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box 8">
			<h2>Pneumonia</h2>
			<p>This serious, sometimes fatal air pollution disease affects young and old alike.  It is mainly caused by bacteria, fungi and parasites found in polluted air.  This is a lung infection that causes the air sacs in one or both lungs to fill with pus, making breathing difficult and causing coughing up phlegm, fever, chills, and chills.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box 9">
			<h2>Leukemia</h2>
			<p>Leukemia is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow that easily causes bruising, joint and bone discomfort, bleeding, weight loss, fever, and other symptoms.Anyone who wants to know what disease is caused by air pollution should know that leukemia can be caused by occupational exposure to benzene, an industrial chemical and a component of gasoline.  Radiation exposure is one of the main causes of leukemia.  and airborne harmful substances, smoking, smoking in the family, etc</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box 10">
			<h2>Breast Cancer</h2>
			<p>A NIEHS sister study found a link between additional harmful compounds in the air and an increased risk of breast cancer, especially methylene chloride, which is used in paint removers and aerosols.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box 11">
			<h2>Heart disease</h2>
			<p>According to a recent study, air pollution accelerates clogged arteries, which increases the risk of coronary heart disease.  Conditions known as coronary artery disease or ischemic heart disease caused by the accumulation of calcium or other substances such as fat inside the coronary artery are diseases caused by air pollution.  In turn, this leads to obstructions that stop blood flow to the heart and other organs.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box 13">
			<h2>Death</h2>
			<p>Some people may experience adverse reactions to certain airborne harmful pollutants, especially those emitted from factories, which can lead to suffocation and death.  An increasing number of young people are dying from diseases and reactions caused by air pollution.</p>
